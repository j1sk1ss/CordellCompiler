# Cordell Compiler
Cordell Compiler is a compact hobby compiler for Cordell Programming Language with a simple syntax, inspired by C and Rust. It is designed for studying compilation, code optimization, translation, and low-level microcode generation.

# Main idea of this project
Main goal of this project is learning of compilers architecture and porting one to CordellOS project (I want to code apps for OS inside this OS). Also, according to my bias to assembly and C languages (I just love them), this language will stay "low-level" as it possible, but some features can be added in future with strings (inbuild concat, comparison and etc).

## Introduction
For additional experience, I chose to take on an extra challenge — creating a programming language. This language has an `EBNF-defined` syntax, its own [VS Code extension](), and documentation. While explaining each layer of the compiler, I will also provide direct examples written in this language.

## EBNF
![EBNF](docs/EBNF.png)

## Sample code snippet
The code below demonstrates the main capabilities of the language, excluding features such as while loops, syscalls, strings, and other advanced constructs. This code will be referenced in other parts of this `README`, and is presented here as an initial example before all further explanations.
```cpl
{
    function sum(i32 a, i32 b) => i32 {
        arr c[2, i32] = { a, b };
        return c[0] + c[1];
    }

    start(i64 argc, ptr u64 argv) {
        i32 a = 10;
        i32 b = 10;
        i32 c = 10;
        i32 d = 10;
        i32 k = 10;
        i32 f = 10;
        if sum(a, b) > (a * b + c + d + k + f); {
            exit 1;
        }
        
        i32 l = ref f;
        exit dref l;
    }
}
```

## Tokenization part
The tokenization part is responsible for splitting the input byte sequence into basic tokens. This module ignores all whitespace and separator symbols (such as newlines and tabs). It also classifies each token into one of the basic types: `number`, `string`, `delimiter`, `comma`, or `dot`.
![tokenization](media/tokenization.png)

### Example of tokenized code
Code above will produce next list of tokens.
```
line=1, type=1, data=[{], 
line=1, type=2, data=[function], 
line=1, type=2, data=[sum], 
line=1, type=1, data=[(], 
line=1, type=2, data=[i32], 
line=1, type=2, data=[a], 
line=1, type=7, data=[,], 
line=1, type=2, data=[i32], 
line=1, type=2, data=[b], 
line=1, type=1, data=[)], 
line=1, type=0, data=[=>], 
<...>
line=16, type=1, data=[}], 
line=17, type=2, data=[i32], 
line=17, type=2, data=[l], 
line=17, type=0, data=[=], 
line=17, type=2, data=[ref], 
line=17, type=2, data=[f], 
line=18, type=6, data=[;], 
line=18, type=2, data=[exit], 
line=18, type=2, data=[dref], 
line=18, type=2, data=[l], 
line=19, type=6, data=[;], 
line=20, type=1, data=[}]
```

## Markup part
The markup stage is the second part of tokenization, but it is separated from the tokenizer in this compiler due to a different design approach. It operates only on the list of tokens and includes support for scopes. The main idea is to perform basic semantic markup of variables — for example, if we declare a variable `i32 a`, all occurrences of `a` within the corresponding scope can be marked as having the `i32` type.
![markup](media/markup.png)

### Example of markup result
```
line=1, type=12, data=[{], 
line=1, type=44, data=[function], 
line=1, type=45, data=[sum], 
line=1, type=10, data=[(], 
line=1, type=24, data=[i32], 
line=1, type=79, data=[a], 
line=1, type=7, data=[,], 
line=1, type=24, data=[i32], 
line=1, type=79, data=[b], 
line=1, type=11, data=[)], 
line=1, type=39, data=[=>],
<...>
line=13, type=6, data=[;], 
line=14, type=12, data=[{], 
line=14, type=38, data=[exit], 
glob line=14, type=3, data=[1], 
line=15, type=6, data=[;], 
line=16, type=13, data=[}], 
line=17, type=24, data=[i32], 
line=17, type=79, data=[l], 
line=17, type=62, data=[=], 
line=17, type=79, data=[f], ref 
line=18, type=6, data=[;], 
line=18, type=38, data=[exit], 
line=18, type=79, data=[l], dref 
line=19, type=6, data=[;], 
line=20, type=13, data=[}]
```

## AST part
Next, we need to parse this sequence of marked tokens to construct an `AST` (Abstract Syntax Tree). There are many approaches to achieve this — for example, `LL` parsing, `LR` parsing, or even `hybrid` techniques that combine `LL` and `LR`. A more complete list of parser types can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compiler-design/types-of-parsers-in-compiler-design/) or in related compiler design books.

### AST optimization
Now we have a correct `AST` representation of the input code. Before proceeding further, we can optionally perform some optimizations at this stage. We will not spend much time here and will only cover a few examples. Note that `AST-level` optimizations are mostly redundant in this project and are included primarily for learning purposes.
- Condition unrolling: If we have an `if` statement with a constant condition, such as `if 1 { ... }`, or similar constructs with `while` or `switch`, we can unroll them by removing the condition and keeping only the scope that will always execute.
- Dead function elimination: This simple technique removes all unused functions.
- Dead scope elimination: If a scope does not affect the environment, it can be removed.

## HIR part
Now we need to convert our `AST` into a simpler representation. A common approach here is to convert the `AST` into `Three-Address Code` (3AC).

### Example of HIR
```
{
    fn sum(i32 a, i32 b) -> i32
    {
        alloc i32s a0;
        load_arg(i32s a0);
        alloc i32s b1;
        load_arg(i32s b1);
        {
            prm_st(i32s a0);
            prm_st(i32s b1);
            alloc arrs c2, size: n2;
            i32t tmp12 = arrs c2[n0];
            i32t tmp13 = arrs c2[n1];
            i32t tmp14 = i32t tmp12 + i32t tmp13;
            return i32t tmp14;
        }
    }
    
    start {
        alloc i64s argc3;
        load_starg(i64s argc3);
        alloc u64s argv4;
        load_starg(u64s argv4);
        {
            alloc i32s a5;
            i32t tmp15 = n10 as i32;
            i32s a5 = i32t tmp15;
            alloc i32s b6;
            i32t tmp16 = n10 as i32;
            i32s b6 = i32t tmp16;
            alloc i32s c7;
            i32t tmp17 = n10 as i32;
            i32s c7 = i32t tmp17;
            alloc i32s d8;
            i32t tmp18 = n10 as i32;
            i32s d8 = i32t tmp18;
            alloc i32s k9;
            i32t tmp19 = n10 as i32;
            i32s k9 = i32t tmp19;
            alloc i32s f10;
            i32t tmp20 = n10 as i32;
            i32s f10 = i32t tmp20;
            store_arg(i32s a5);
            store_arg(i32s b6);
            i32t tmp21 = call sum(i32 a, i32 b) -> i32, argc c2;
            i32t tmp22 = i32s a5 * i32s b6;
            i32t tmp23 = i32t tmp22 + i32s c7;
            i32t tmp24 = i32t tmp23 + i32s d8;
            i32t tmp25 = i32t tmp24 + i32s k9;
            i32t tmp26 = i32t tmp25 + i32s f10;
            i32t tmp27 = i32t tmp21 > i32t tmp26;
            if i32t tmp27, goto l73;
            {
                exit n1;
            }
            l73:
            alloc i32s l11;
            u64t tmp28 = &(i32s f10);
            i32t tmp29 = u64t tmp28 as i32;
            i32s l11 = i32t tmp29;
            exit i32s l11;
        }
    }
}
```

## CFG part
With `3AC`, we can move on to `CFG` (Control Flow Graph) creation. There are several ways to split `3AC` into basic blocks. One approach is using `leaders`, while another is to create a block for every command. The second approach is straightforward — each `3AC` instruction becomes its own block. The `leaders` approach, described in the *Dragon Book*, defines three rules for identifying the start of a block:

- The first instruction in a function.
- The target of a JMP instruction.
- The instruction immediately following a JMP.

In this compiler, both approaches are implemented, but for the following explanations, we will use the approach of creating a block for every command.
